Oak: Oh, [PLAYER]!\nHow is my old Pok\emon?\pWell, it seems to be growing more\nattached to you.\pYou must be talented as a Pok\emon\nTrainer.\pWhat's that?\nYou have something for me?

#org @gText_ProfOak_0X18E536
On the desk there is my invention,\nthe Pok\edex!\pIt automatically records data on\nPok\emon you've seen or caught.\pIt's a high-tech encyclopedia!

#org @gText_ProfOak_0X18E5C5
Oak: [PLAYER] and [RIVAL].\nTake these with you.

#org @gText_ProfOak_0X18E612
Oak: You can't get detailed data\non Pok\emon by just seeing them.\pYou must catch them to obtain\ncomplete data.\pSo, here are some tools for\ncatching wild Pok\emon.

#org @gText_ProfOak_0X18E6B3
[PLAYER] received five Pok\e Balls.

#org @gText_ProfOak_0X18E6D0
When a wild Pok\emon appears,\nit's fair game.\pJust throw a Pok\e Ball at it and\ntry to catch it!\pThis won't always work, however.\pA healthy Pok\emon can escape.\nYou have to be lucky!

To make a complete guide on all\nthe Pok\emon in the world[.]\pThat was my dream!\pBut, I'm too old.\nI can't get the job done.\pSo, I want you two to fulfill my\ndream for me.\pGet moving, you two.\pThis is a great undertaking in\nPok\emon history!
