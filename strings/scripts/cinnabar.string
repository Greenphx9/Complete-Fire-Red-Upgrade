#org @gText_AkioHi
???: Oh, Hello there.\nMy name is Akio.\pYou probably don't know me. I worked\non a project called Operation:\lMewtwo a long, long time ago.\pThe project was a half success and\nhalf failure. Our goal was to clone\lMew, to make the ultimate Pok\emon.\pIt worked, but we could not control\nhim. In the process of cloning, we\lmade the Pok\emon [GREEN]Ditto [BLUE].\pYou have probably seen them before.\nPurple blobs that can turn into\lother Pok\emon.\pThat's not all, however. One night, I\nwas testing alone, and I made this\lPok\emon that I called MissingNo. It\lwas super powerful, but I couldn't\lcontrol it. It escaped, and I\lbelieve it resides on this island.\pMissingNo cannot be seen unless\nbattling, so I suggest to try and\linteract with the air around the\lisland.\pIf you find it, meet me in Viridian\nCity.\pGood luck.

[BLUE]When I searched the mansion, I\ncouldn't find any cloned Pok\emon,\lonly weird trainers.\pOne of those trainers told me there\nwere [GREEN]Legendary Pok\emon [BLUE]roaming\laround Kanto, and when I checked\lmy map, I saw them! Let me add\lthem to your map real quick.

You do?\nWow[.] you're the first person ever!\pI've developed this program that\ntheoretically, can force a wild\lbattle against the god himself,\l[GREEN]Arceus[BLUE].\pIt refuses to work without 3 other\nPok\emon, which have to be the\l[GREEN]Creation Trio[BLUE], since Arceus made\lthem!\pLet me try the program now.\p[BLACK]Bzzzt!
