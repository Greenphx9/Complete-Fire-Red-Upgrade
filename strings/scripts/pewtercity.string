You will never face Brock!\nYou have to beat me first!

#org @gText_EmmaBeat
You are so strong!\nGood luck challenging Brock!

#org @gText_EmmaAfter
Brock is strong, but you\nmight be stronger!

#org @gText_PewterScientist_0X17E902
Oh, [PLAYER]!

#org @gText_PewterScientist_0X17E90C
I'm glad I caught up to you.\nI'm Prof. Oak's Aide.\pProf Oak wanted me to give this\nEevee to you.\pEevee can evolve into many different\nPok\emon. Here you go.

#org @gText_PewterScientist_0X17E970
[PLAYER] received the\nRunning Shoes from the Aide.

#org @gText_NameEeveeQuestion
Would you like to give a\nnickname to Eevee?

#org @gText_RecieveEevee
[PLAYER] recieved an Eevee\nfrom the Aid!

#org @gText_PewterScientist_0X17EA06
Well, I must be going back to\nthe Lab.\pBye-bye!

#org @gText_BrockBeforeBattle
So, you're here. I'm Brock.\nI'm Pewter's Gym Leader.\pMy rock-hard willpower is evident\neven in my Pok\emon.\pMy Pok\emon are all rock hard, and\nhave true-grit determination.\pThat's right - my Pok\emon are all\nthe Rock type!\pFuhaha! You're going to challenge\nme knowing that you'll lose?\pThat's the Trainer's honor that\ncompels you to challenge me.\pFine, then!\nShow me your best!

#org @gText_BrockBeforeRematch
So, you're back?\nWhat happened after you left?\p[.] [.] [.]\n[.] [.]\pAh, so you got all 8 gym badges!\nThat must mean you're here for a\lrematch.\pMy rock Pok\emon and I will take you\ndown!

#org @gText_BrockRematchLose
I can't believe I lost[.] again!

#org @gText_BrockRematchAfter2
I can't believe I lost to you twice[.]\n[PLAYER], I believe you can become\lthe new champion of Kanto!

#org @gText_BrockRematchAfter1
Before you go, take these items.\nThey aren't useful to me.

#org @gText_IlimaHello
Oh, hello there.\nMy name's [GREEN]Ilima[BLUE], and I come from\lthe [GREEN]Alola[BLUE] region.\pMy friend, Kukui, asked me to travel to\nKanto and report on the Pok\emon\lhere. Pretty diverse, isn't it? I've\lfound Pok\emon from every region.\pAnyways, what's your name?\n[.]\pSo it's [PLAYER]. You seem promising,\nbut first, let's have a battle!

#org @gText_IlimaLost
Well done!

#org @gText_IlimaAfter
That was a good battle, you battle\nlike a friend I know back in Alola.\pWell, [PLAYER], I got to get going.\nBye!

#org @gText_WantBuyFeebas
Hey there[.]\nWant to buy a super rare and\lpowerful Pok\emon for \$1000?

#org @gText_NoFeebas
You're missing out on an amazing\ndeal! The deal of the century!

#org @gText_FeebasNoMoney
You don't have enough money!

#org @gText_RecieveFeebas
[BLACK][PLAYER] paid \$1000 and recieved a\nFeebas[.]

#org @gText_GtgFeebas
What? Feebas isn't powerful?\nNonsense!

#org @gText_HiTylerSky
[BLUE]Hey there newbie!\nMy name's [GREEN]Tyler[BLUE] and I'm the\lgreatest trainer ever!\pWhy's that? Because I use elegant\nflying Pok\emon! Care for a [GREEN]Sky\lBattle[BLUE]? It's only fair if we both\luse flying types!

#org @gText_NoTylerSky
[BLUE]Hah! You're too weak!

#org @gText_NoSkyTylerSky
[BLUE]Bruh[.] you have no flying Pok\emon?\nHow weak can you be?

#org @gText_PrepareTylerSky
[BLUE]Prepare to be thrown to the ground!

#org @gText_TylerSkyLose
Wha?\nDo you have a GameShark? You must\lbe cheating! I'm the best trainer!

#org @gText_TylerGiveTm
[BLUE][.]\nWell, I suppose you can have this\lTM.

#org @gText_TylerExplainRoost
[BLUE]TM51 contains the move Roost.\nIt heals your Pok\emon's health, but\lremoves the flying type from it.

#org @gText_AskCosmicPower
The secrets of space[.]\nThe mysteries of earth[.]\pThere are so many things about\nwhich we know so little.\pBut that should spur us to study\nharder, not just give up.\pThe cosmic power of space is\nincredible, don't you think?\pAnyways, speaking of cosmic power, I\ncan teach the move Cosmic Power to\lany of your Pok\emon.\pShould I teach that to a Pok\emon?

#org @gText_NoCosmicPower
Is that so?\nI'm sure you'll be back for it.

#org @gText_WhichMonCosmicPower
Which Pok\emon wants to learn\nCosmic Power?

#org @gText_NowKnowsCosmicPower
Your Pok\emon now knows Cosmic Power.\

#org @gText_StevenHiWeak
Hi.\nMy name's Steven. I'm staying here\lin Kanto for a while with my Dad.\pI would battle you, but you seem a\nbit weak. Come back when you are\lstronger.

#org @gText_StevenHiStrong
Hi.\nMy name's Steven. I'm staying here\lin Kanto for a while with my Dad.\pYou seem strong. Do you want to\nhave a battle? I won't go easy!

#org @gText_StevenNoBattle
Alright, then. Come back later.

#org @gText_StevenBattleBefore
Let's do this!

#org @gText_StevenLose
I, the Hoenn Champion, fall in\ndefeat[.] Kudos to you, [PLAYER]!\lYou are truly a Noble Pok\emon\lTrainer!

#org @gText_StevenAfterGive
You remind me of a kid back in\nHoenn who also beat me, you kids\lare so strong these days[.]\pAnyways,\nyou'll probably need these Mega\lStones. They aren't of any use to\lme.

#org @gText_StevenGiveItems1
Also, you might already have these\nitems, but they could be useful if\lyou don't.

#org @gText_StevenGiveMeta
And finally, a Mega Stone for my\nfavourite Pok\emon. Don't worry, I\lhave multiple.

#org @gText_StevenExplain
The Mega Stone is for Metagross.\nWhen it mega evolves, it becomes\lsuper powerful, and gains the\lability Tough Claws.

#org @gText_ICanTeachHealBell
Hi! If you want, I can teach the\nmove [GREEN]Heal Bell[RED] to any of your\lPok\emon.\pIt'll cost, though. [GREEN]\$500[RED]. Do you\nwant it?

#org @gText_No500Money
You don't even have \$500[.]\nI feel bad for you. Come back\lanother time then.

#org @gText_WhichLearnHealBell
Which Pok\emon wants to learn Heal\nBell?

#org @gText_NoHealBell
How could you ever decline a deal\nlike that? Whatever[.]

#org @gText_GotHealBell
There you go. You now have the move\n[GREEN]Heal Bell[RED].

#org @gText_Now500
Now, the \$500, please.

#org @gText_YouGave500To
[BLACK]You gave \$500 to the girl!

#org @gText_ComeBackHealBell
Come back if you need [GREEN]Heal\nBell[RED] taught to any other Pok\emon.

#org @gText_BrockDefeated
I took you for granted, and so\nI lost.

#org @gText_BrockGiveBoulderBadge
As proof of your victory, I confer\non you this[.]the official Pok\emon\lLeague BoulderBadge.

#org @gText_GiveBoulderBadge
[BLACK][PLAYER] received the\nBoulderBadge from Brock!

#org @gText_GiveTM39
The BoulderBadge enables the\nuse of the move Flash outside of\lbattle.\pOf course, a Pok\emon must know the\nmove Flash to use it.

#org @gText_BeforeYouGoTakeTM39
Before you go, take this with you.
