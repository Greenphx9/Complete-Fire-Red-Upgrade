Which move should I teach?

#org @gText_ExplosionTMShow
Hello there, young trainer.\nIf you can show me a Pok\emon with\la high base Attack or low base HP,\lI'll give you an exclusive TM.

#org @gText_ExplosionNoTM
Come back when you need this TM,\nthen.

#org @gText_LetMeSee
Let me see[.]

#org @gText_NoExplosion
Sorry, this Pok\emon does not have\nhigh enough Attack or low enough\lHP.

#org @gText_GoodStatsExplosion
This Pok\emon has a [BUFFER1] base\nAttack and [BUFFER2] base HP.\pThose are good enough stats! Take\nthis TM.

#org @gText_TM64Explain
TM64 contains the move Explosion. It\ndeals huge damage to all Pok\emon\lon the field, but faints the user.

#org @gText_PokemonBreederAsk
Hi.\nI'm a Pok\emon Breeder.\pIf you can beat me in a Pok\emon\nbattle, I'll give you an egg and a\lTM.\pDo you want to battle?

I might be a Pok\emon Breeder, but I\ndon't battle with Baby Pok\emon!

#org @gText_BreederHereEgg
Well, here's the things I promised.\nThe egg, and the TM.

#org @gText_BreederExplain
The egg contains the Pok\emon\n[GREEN]Riolu[RED]. It's a pretty powerful\lPok\emon, and even more powerful\lwhen it evolves.\pThe TM contains the move [GREEN]Power-up\nPunch[RED]. It deals little damage, but\lalways raises your Pok\emon's\lAttack stat.

#org @gText_ComeBackMegaBreeder
Come back when you have more\nbadges, and I'll give you a Mega\lStone.

#org @gText_PlayerRecievedEgg

#org @gText_ComeBackKnockOff

#org @gText_WhichFangMove
Which move should I teach to your\nPok\emon?

#org @gText_ThanksForTeachingFang
Thanks for letting me teach your\nPok\emon a move.\pEvery other trainer that comes here\njust leaves immediately[.] Do they\lthink I'm useless?

#org @gText_ImMasterTrappingMoves
