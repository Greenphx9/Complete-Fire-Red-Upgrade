[RED]May: Oh, hi [PLAYER]! I just gave a\n[GREEN]Mega Ring [RED]to [GREEN]Koga.[RED]\pIf you are going to challenge him,\nlet me make sure you are strong\lenough!

#org @gText_MayFuschiaLose
You can definitely beat Koga!

#org @gText_MayFuschiaAfter
[RED]May: I have to go now, need to\ngive [GREEN]Blaine[RED] his [GREEN]Mega Ring[RED].\pSee you later!

#org @gText_AskTeachDraco
Dragon types are the best, don't you\nthink?\pThey have the highest Base Stat\nTotal of Pok\emon, look cool, and\lcan learn the exclusive move [GREEN]Draco\lMeteor[BLUE].\pSpeaking of [GREEN]Draco Meteor[BLUE], I can\nteach it to any Dragon type you\lhave. Shall I?

#org @gText_SelectDragon
Select a Dragon type Pok\emon.

#org @gText_MissingOutDraco
You're missing out on a great move!

#org @gText_NotADragon
Are you kidding[.]?

#org @gText_CongratsDraco
Congrats! Your dragon type\nlearnt [GREEN]Draco Meteor[BLUE]! Have fun\ldestroying any non-fairy type!

#org @gText_ICanTeachTutor
I can teach [GREEN]Keldeo[BLUE], [GREEN]Meloetta[BLUE],\n[GREEN]Rayquaza[BLUE], and [GREEN]Zygarde[BLUE] their\lexclusive moves. Want me to?

#org @gText_WhichLegendMove
Which move do you need?

#org @gText_MoveTaught
The move has been taught.\nCome back later if you need any\lmore moves to be taught!

#org @gText_GiveSubTM
Aww, I wish I was a Kangaskhan\nbaby.\pI'd love to be a substitute for the\nbaby[.]\pAnd snuggle in the mother\nKangaskhan's belly pouch.\pBut only Pok\emon can use the\ntechnique Substitute[.]\pSo take this TM, it contains the move\nSubstitute.

#org @gText_KogaBeforeRematch
Ah, [PLAYER]! It's been so long.\nI assume you want some help\lregarding Poison-type Pok\emon?\p[.] [.] [.]\n[.]\pNo? You want to have a rematch[.]\nSure! Be prepared! I'm not going\leasy this time!

#org @gText_TalkSubTM
Boy, what I'd give to crawl inside\na Kangaskhan belly pouch[.]

#org @gText_KogaRematchLose
Humph! Once again, you defeated me!

#org @gText_KogaRematchAfter2
TM103 contains the move Sludge\nWave.\pIt's similar to Sludge Bomb, but is\nmore powerful.\pIt has a smaller chance to poison\nthe enemy however, so it's better\lthan Sludge Bomb sometimes, and\lworse at other times.

#org @gText_KogaRematchAfter1
Since you've beat me again, you\ndeserve a reward. Take this TM,\land these items.

#org @gText_ImAMoveTutor
I'm a move tutor!\pWant me to teach your Pok\emon a\nmove?

#org @gText_EverInNeedForAMove
If you ever are in need for a\nmove, come back!

#org @gText_SelectMoveFuschia
Well, that's just fine!\pPick the move you want me to\nteach!

#org @gText_MayIOldAmber
Hi! If you have an Old Amber, I\ncan turn it into an [GREEN]Aerodactyl[BLUE].\pMay I?

#org @gText_YouDontHaveOldAmber
You don't have an Old Amber[.]

#org @gText_HandOverOldAmber
Please hand over the Old Amber.

#org @gText_HandedOver
[BLACK][PLAYER] handed the Old Amber over\nto the man.

#org @gText_USeMachineAmber
Now, I'll use this tiny machine to\nrestore it[.]

#org @gText_HereYouGoAmber
Here you go!

#org @gText_RecievedAero
[BLACK][PLAYER] received an Aerodactyl!

#org @gText_DifferentParty
I heard that some Pok\emon evolve\ninto different formes if you have a\lcertain type in your party.\pWhy don't you try it?

#org @gText_DefeatedKoga
Humph!\nYou have proven your worth!

#org @gText_TakeSoulBadge
Here!\nTake the SoulBadge!

#org @gText_GiveSoulBadge
[BLACK][PLAYER] received the\nSoulBadge from Koga!

#org @gText_TakeTM09
