# Complete Fire Red Upgrade

## What is this?
This is my fork of the CFRU for my hack Inflamed Red. It includes all the sprites, code, scripts, etc. Before using anything, please read below!

## What can I use from this fork?
You can freely use any of the code from this fork. Credit Skeli for the TM Case code Time Box code, Scalemons code, soupercell for the new AI improvements, hard mode system, new attack animations, The SkiDY for the duplicate ability system, stevebel / mostmodest for the multiple palette table system, and me for everything else. You are allowed to use the scripts from this fork as long as you don't copy them 1 for 1, and give me credit. You are NOT allowed to use any new sprites you see here. Read below if you want to know why.

## Why can't I use the sprites from this fork?
Most, if not all, of the new sprites in this repo were NOT made by me. I don't want you using it & crediting me because I didn't make it. You can find a small list of credits on Inflamed Red forum page.
